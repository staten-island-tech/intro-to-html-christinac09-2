    <h1>About me: Christina</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Christina. I am a sophomore in SITHS. Over the summer, I worked at the school in SDI, where I
        improved my skills in Python and learned to use platforms like Tkinter and Pygame. I also went to Herhseypark
        with my family and family friends. I enjoy doing math and programming. Some of my hobbies are reading and dance.
        I grew up in Brooklyn but moved to Staten Island when I was in eighth grade. What I look forward to this year is
        attending clubs and school events. I do not look forward to homework (and serp).
